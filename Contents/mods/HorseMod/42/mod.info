description=The Horse mod adds horses to Project Zomboid, allowing the player to care for them, ride them, and much more. A stamina system makes riding feel more realistic. Craft a saddle to make your rides more comfortable, or live the life of a true nomad by adding saddlebags to your horse. If you prefer a rancher’s lifestyle, you can also craft glue from horse hooves, which works similarly to wood glue.
