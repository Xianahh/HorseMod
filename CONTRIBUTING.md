# Contributing
How to help out:
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/PZ-HorseTeam/HorseMod/issues) for bug reports.
- [Start a discussion](https://github.com/PZ-HorseTeam/HorseMod/discussions/categories/ideas) for suggestions or feature requests.

We also accept pull requests for bug fixes and improvements.
Contributors should keep the following in mind:
- We reserve the right to be picky about what features make it into the mod, as well as the style/quality of any contributions.
  - It is recommended to consult with the core contributors first through discussions before starting work to see if it's something we would be interested in.
  - Keep in mind that if we don't want to include something in the main mod, you can still make it as an addon, so long as it follows the rules laid out in our [license](https://github.com/PZ-HorseTeam/HorseMod/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
- Any contributions to the mod will be irrevokably licensed under our [license](https://github.com/PZ-HorseTeam/HorseMod/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). By contributing you acknowledge that you have read and understood our license and agree for your work to be licensed under it.
  - While we intend to play nice when we can, we are not obligated to remove any content if the original author changes their mind.
- We will not accept contributions created using machine learning/AI.
